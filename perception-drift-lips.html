      <h2>“Perception Drift” and Lips: When Aesthetic Standards Lose Touch with Natural Beauty</h2>

      <p>In aesthetic medicine, lips are often the focal point of enhancement. Symbolizing youth and femininity, they attract attention — and treatments. But increasingly, we see results that feel exaggerated, unnatural, or disproportionate.</p>

      <h3>Why is this happening?</h3>

      <h4>Is it Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)?</h4>
      <p>Not usually. In a recent study, only 8.2% of aesthetic practitioners screened positive for BDD — higher than the general population, but still a minority. So what explains the widespread trend of overfilled lips?</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>The Real Culprit: Perception Drift</h3>

      <p><strong>Perception Drift</strong> is a gradual, unconscious shift in beauty standards that occurs with repeated treatments. What once looked full starts to appear normal. And once that becomes the new baseline, more filler is added to “restore” volume that never left.</p>

      <p>Perception Drift is not a psychiatric disorder. It is beauty distortion disguised as progress.</p>

      <p>Over time, both practitioners and patients may lose sight of what’s natural. The new “normal” becomes subtly exaggerated — until it’s not so subtle anymore.</p>

      <h3>Why Lips Are Especially Affected</h3>
      <p>Lips are highly visible, so even small changes become normalized quickly. Combined with constant exposure to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filtered images and beauty apps</li>
        <li>Celebrities and influencers with enhanced features</li>
        <li>Clinics sharing only “after” photos</li>
      </ul>
      <p>...it becomes easy to mistake excess for enhancement — even for experienced professionals.</p>

      <h3>How to Prevent Overfilled Lips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use before-and-after photos to assess changes objectively.</li>
        <li>Encourage rest periods between treatments.</li>
        <li>Discuss goals honestly and review facial balance regularly.</li>
        <li>Educate patients on what looks harmonious and natural.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        “We have a duty of care to recognize Perception Drift — in our patients, and in ourselves.”
      </blockquote>
