      <h2>“Perception Drift” and Lips: When Aesthetic Standards Lose Touch with Natural Beauty</h2>
      <p>
        In aesthetic medicine, lips are often the focal point of enhancement. Symbolizing youth and femininity, they attract attention — and treatments. But increasingly, we see results that feel exaggerated, unnatural, or disproportionate.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>

      <h3>Is it Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)?</h3>
      <p>
        Not usually. In a recent study, only 8.2% of aesthetic practitioners screened positive for BDD — higher than the general population, but still a minority. So what explains the widespread trend of overfilled lips?
      </p>

      <h3>The Real Culprit: Perception Drift</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>“Perception Drift”</strong> is a gradual, unconscious shift in beauty standards that occurs with repeated treatments. What once looked full starts to appear normal. “Normal” then begins to feel underwhelming — and more filler is added.
      </p>
      <p><em>Perception Drift is not a psychiatric disorder. It’s a distortion of beauty, masked as progress.</em></p>
      <p>
        Over time, both practitioners and patients may lose sight of what’s natural. The new normal becomes subtly exaggerated — until it’s not so subtle anymore.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Does Perception Drift Happen with Lips?</h3>
      <p>
        Lips are highly visible, so even small changes are quickly normalized. Combined with social media filters, celebrity influence, and echo chambers of overfilled results, it becomes easy to mistake excess for enhancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even skilled professionals can fall into the trap — not from lack of training, but from constant visual exposure to unnatural norms.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Prevent Overfilled Lips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use before-and-after photos to track changes over time.</li>
        <li>Encourage rest periods between treatments.</li>
        <li>Have honest conversations about what looks balanced and natural.</li>
        <li>Educate patients — and ourselves — continuously.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        “We have a duty of care to recognize Perception Drift — in our patients, and in ourselves.”
      </blockquote>
