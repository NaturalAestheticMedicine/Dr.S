      <h2>“Perception Drift” and Lips: When Aesthetic Standards Lose Touch with Natural Beauty</h2>
      <p>
        In aesthetic medicine, lips are often the focal point of enhancement. Symbolizing youth and femininity, they attract attention — and treatments. But increasingly, we see results that feel exaggerated, unnatural, or disproportionate.<br />
        <strong>Why is this happening?</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Is it Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)?</h3>
      <p>
        Not usually. In a recent study, only 8.2% of aesthetic practitioners screened positive for BDD — higher than the general population, but still a minority. So what explains the widespread trend of overfilled lips?
      </p>

      <h3>The Real Culprit: Perception Drift</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>“Perception Drift”</strong> is a gradual, unconscious shift in beauty standards that occurs with repeated treatments. What once looked full starts to appear normal. “Normal” then begins to feel underwhelming — and more filler is added.
      </p>
      <p><em>Perception Drift is not a psychiatric disorder.<br />It’s a distortion of beauty, masked as progress.</em></p>
      <p>Over time, both practitioners and patients may lose sight of what’s natural. The new normal becomes subtly exaggerated — until it’s not so subtle anymore.</p>

      <h3>Why Does Perception Drift Happen with Lips?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Social media filters</li>
        <li>Celebrity influence</li>
        <li>Echo chambers of overfilled results</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lips are highly visible, so changes (even small ones) are quickly normalized. Even skilled professionals can fall into the trap — not from lack of training, but from constant visual exposure to unnatural norms.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Prevent Overfilled Lips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Use before-and-after photos to track changes over time.</li>
        <li>✅ Encourage rest periods between treatments.</li>
        <li>✅ Have honest conversations about what looks balanced and natural.</li>
        <li>✅ Most importantly: Educate patients and ourselves.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>“We have a duty of care to recognize Perception Drift — in our patients, and in ourselves.”</blockquote>
